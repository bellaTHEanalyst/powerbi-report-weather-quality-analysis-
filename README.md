## Introduction
I’m Isabella Martins, and I’m excited to share some insights about your business. This is a power project on predictive analysis of air quality using regression. Thank you for providing the guiding questions. It was helpful to see what types of insights you are looking to gain from the data. I hope you find the analysis compelling and helpful as you make decisions regarding future business opportunities.
## Problem Objective
This project is on a company in the environmental consulting industry that is seeking to analyze the air quality in a specific city during hot and cold weather, during high-wind conditions in air quality, analyze and derive insights to help make recommendations to give the government and business in the region on how to mitigate the impact of weather conditions on air quality.
## Problem statement
1. What is air quality?

2. What does PM 2.5 mean in air quality?

3. What weather factors influenced the PM 2.5 value?

4. What years recorded the highest and lowest PM 2.5 value?

5. What is the predictions on PM2.5 value in air quality in the next 4 years?

## Data Set Information
- Number of attributes: 13
- Missing values : Yes 
- Duplicate values : No
##S KILLS/CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED
- Power Query
- Dax
- Modeling
- Quick measure
## MODELLING
I tried to create a relationship using date tabels,though it wasn’t necessary as we have just  one fact table and no dimension table, but a relationship was created between tables using the dates.

## Data Preparation/Cleaning
- The dataset contained 13 columns and 41,757 rows.
1. I made first rows as headers
2. I filtered out all null values
3. I changed datatype from 'TEXT" to 'WHOLE NUMBER'
4. I created a new measur for month as “short_month”
